<h1>Description</h1>
</h3>Existential brings to light the uncomfortable concept of life after death and the process of grief. In today’s society, we avoid confronting the topic of death because we often associate death with tragedy and sadness. While these feelings are completely acceptable, Existential aims to highlight grief and provide depth into the process of acceptance. Death is natural and a fundamental end to life, and we would like to provide a different perspective on life and death.</h3>
