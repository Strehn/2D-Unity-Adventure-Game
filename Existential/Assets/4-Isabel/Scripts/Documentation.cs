/* Documentation for Main Character Prefab
 * Written by Isabel Hinkle
 * Have you ever wanted to create a 2D orthographic game that utilizes pixel art?
 * Well, look no further! The Main Character Prefab contains a sprite 2D UI image for our pixel art character, Estelle!
 * The prefab will come loaded with:
 *  - A main camera attached
 *  - An audio source
 *  - A sound script (which features a large array of sounds collected) 
 *    to play sounds as the main character traverses through your wonderful Unity game
 *  - The player controller rigid body script (also written by me) which is used to move the player on screen
 *  - A rigidbody 2D for movement
 *  - A box collider 2D for interactions with other NPC's, inventory objects, boundaries... the sky is the limit!
 * Prefab features:
 *  - Complete flexibility to use with other sprites
 *  - The freedom to scale the prefab
 *  - The freedom to transform the prefab's position starting on screen 
 *  - The ability to change the sorting layer
 * Tech Specs:
 *  - Unity 2019
 *  - Clean, well-documented C# scripts for all components
 *  - Mobile friendly - Android
 * Refund Policy:
 *  - This prefab is free on the Unity Asset Store for a limited time - so download it now!
 *  - Otherwise, we will not accept refunds due to short staffing :/
